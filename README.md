## How It Works:

The COVID-19 Tracker App is able to acquire publicly available and up to date data using a technology called API. APIs, act as intermediaries and facilitate data retrieval for web apps. The web app sends a request to the API, specifying the desired data. The API processes the request, retrieves the data from a server or database, and formats it into a structured format, often JSON or XML. This formatted data is then transmitted back to the web app via HTTP/HTTPS. Finally, the web app interprets and displays the received data, enabling users to access and interact with it seamlessly.
